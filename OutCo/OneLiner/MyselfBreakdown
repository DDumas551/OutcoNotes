who i am
    Hi, my name is David. I am an Front end engineer and 
    I love React.
    I am excited to focus on learning and building 
    excellent client side experiences

what drives me
    my first experiences with coding were with Visual Basic 
    and Ruby in high school, building simple apps with VB and 
    RPG games with Ruby and a software called RPG Maker 2000.
    The process of building interactive components was and definitely
    is still very exciting

    I starting looking into javascript about a year and a half ago and
    upon making my first onClick to work, I was hooked

what im doing now
    I'm currently working on two apps using React, each with
    different databases. I'm focusing on ease of use and simple,
    easy to use layouts.


how i will add value to the company
    I will be pulling from my experiences in the various industries
    i've worked in to create high quality and attractive web interfaces
